                    Watercolor paint is an ancient form of painting, if not the most ancient form of art itself. <br> In East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as brush painting or scroll painting.<br> In Chinese, Korean and Japanese
                    painting it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns, often using inkstick or other pigments. <br> India, Ethiopia and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well. Many Western artists,
                    especially in the early 19th century, used watercolor primarily as a sketching tool in preparation for the "finished" work in oil or engraving.[15] Until the end of the eighteenth century, traditional watercolors were known as 'tinted
                    drawings'.

                    The conventional and most common support — material to which the paint is applied—for watercolor paintings is watercolor paper. <br> Other supports or substrates include stone, ivory, silk, reed, papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum,
                    leather, fabric, wood, and watercolor canvas (coated with a gesso that is specially formulated for use with watercolors). <br> Watercolor paper is often made entirely or partially with cotton. This gives the surface the appropriate
                    texture and minimizes distortion when wet.<br> Watercolor papers are usually cold-pressed papers that provide better texture and appearance with a weight at least 300 gsm. <br> Under 300 gsm is commonly not recommended for anything
                    but sketching.<br> Transparency is the main characteristic of watercolors.<br> Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding Chinese white. <br> This is not a method to be used in "true watercolor" (traditional).
