                    <b>What are Oil Pastels?</b>
                    <br>

                    <b>Oil pastels</b> come in a crayon or stick form and are made of pigments combined with a binder. <br> The binder is a mixture of waxes and mineral oils, so you get a type of soft and slightly somewhat greasy stick that does not dry.
                    There are other similar drawing mediums like crayons and pastel sticks.<br> There are also different types of pastels including soft pastels (or pastel sticks), hard pastels, pencil pastels, and pan pastels.
                    <br>
                    <b>U</b>sing oil pastels is fun and easy to do, and is something that can be done by both the young and old, beginner and professional. <br> However, just like everything else you need to learn a few techniques and practice until you
                    can create a good art piece. <br> Do not give up on your first try! Oil pastel painting can be rewarding once you get the hang of it. <br> Not only that, but the oil pastels themselves are affordable, easy to transport, simple to use,
                    and easy to keep clean.<br> With a little practice, you will be producing wonderful art that has texture and beautiful colors.
